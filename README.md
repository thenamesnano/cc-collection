# cc-collection : ComputerCraft Collection

This is a collection of LUA scripts I wrote while playing the Minecraft mod ComputerCraft.
These scripts are unlikely to be updated or optimized, and in their current state are probably hacky solutions.
The purpose of this repository is to preserve these files for personal use.
